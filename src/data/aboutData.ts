            subtitle: "HOW IT ALL STARTED",
            content: `Prior to 1984, there was no Madrasa in all the Estates in the whole neighborhood of Langata comprising Southlands, Ngei 1 and Ngei 2., Akiba, Onyonka, Otiende, Jambo, Rubia, Customs, Masai, Civil Servants, Uhuru Gardens, etc. Of course there was no mosque either. At the time there were close to 20 churches in the vicinity.

To attend a Madrasa, children had to go to Kibra or South C. The parents had a difficult duty of transporting them to and from such distant places. This led to some parents engaging private Ustadhs/Ustadhas to teach their children at home. In some cases some children did not attend Madrasas at all.`

        {
            subtitle: "ESTABLISHING A MADRASA",
            content: `It is this inconvenience which eventually brought a few Muslims together sometime in 1984, with a view to start a Madrasa within the neighborhood. As a quick solution, one of the pioneer members, Marhum Said Omar Nadhir, volunteered to surrender his official car garage at the Customs Estate to be converted into a Madrasa. He also sourced the very first Ustadh for the Madrasa, Ustadh Hassan Komesha. Once the Madrasa was up and running in 1985, the initiators went door to door to all houses in the neighborhood occupied by Muslims on a campaign to advertise the same.

The number of students grew so fast that within no time the one garage was not adequate to accommodate all of them. Luckily, the occupier of the garage adjacent to the Madrasa, and who was not even a Muslim, offered the use of his garage to host the students. Thus the Madrasa expanded.

During this period, the Madrasa was very vibrant and lively, and a number of prize-giving ceremonies were hosted within the Customs Estate grounds.`

            subtitle: "FORMATION OF LIWO",
            content: `It was realized that relying on hosting the Madrasa in the garages of a Government owned Estate was not sustainable. The occupiers of those garages who were public servants could be transferred anytime and the new occupiers might not be as cooperative.

To this end, Langata Islamic Welfare Organisation (LIWO) was established with the cardinal purpose of seeking a more secure place to host the Madrasa as well as dealing with all matters pertaining to Islam. Membership comprised both the old and young. Although the application for registration was lodged immediately, LIWO was eventually issued with the Certificate on 11th August 2009 after several of the interim officials underwent thorough vetting and interrogation by the Government security agencies.

Prior to and after the registration, meetings were being held literally every weekend in the Madrasa to plot how to achieve the intended goals. Attendance was always house full, indicating how eager the members were in getting a solution.`

            subtitle: "PURCHASE OF PLOT NO. 1: LR 2940",
            content: `The efforts to get a solution led to us getting an offer to buy the plot where the current mosque stands. Although the owner of the plot, the late Mr. Mbau, was not a Muslim, he was surprisingly very intent on selling it to Muslims. We negotiated and agreed on the price of Kshs. 1.8 million and he gave us ample time to raise the money despite receiving better offers from other potential buyers.

At the time of entering into a Sale Agreement, we had just about Kshs. 40,000/- in our coffers. Nevertheless we were confident of meeting the demand. We quickly devised strategies to raise funds, including printing of receipt books for individual members to collect money from friends, acquaintances and well-wishers, visiting various mosques on Fridays to seek for donations from the respective congregations, hosting food bazaars, approaching Muslim businessmen to assist, etc.

A major Harambee was organized on 1st April 1995, where the proceeds of all the fundraising efforts were consolidated. The Guests of honour were Marhum Abdul-Rahman Abbas (a renowned businessman) and Marhum Ahmed Abdalla (former Deputy Governor of Central Bank). The two were the Patrons of LIWO from its inception and remained supportive all through their lives.

The actual number of attendees in the Harambee was not huge, but the amount raised passed expectations. What was collected was more than enough to complete the payments for the purchase of the plot. The extra money raised went into the construction of the temporary Madrasa which was completed and also used as the prayer room. Currently this is the structure hosting our offices.`
        },
        {
            subtitle: "CONSTRUCTION OF THE TEMPORARY MOSQUE",
            content: `After securing the plot and the building of the temporary Madrasa, focus was then shifted to the construction of a temporary mosque.

In this we were fortunate to get the assistance of Marhum Hassan Jeizan who had a network of people willing to help in such projects. On his part Brother Hassan provided some of the materials needed while LIWO financed the rest. LIWO also took care of the daily labour costs. Whenever required, ordinary members offered themselves as labour. So the temporary mosque was essentially built through collective efforts of all.

Ground breaking ceremony for the temporary mosque was held on 25th December 1998, and construction continued at the pace we could manage.

In this particular project, it is imperative to mention the exemplary and selfless support offered by our brother Juma Abdalla Kathenge. Many a time he agreed to give us materials from his Hardware shop on credit, for us to pay him later. This enabled us to continue with construction even when we did not have money. In fact part of his debt was paid well after the mosque was completed while he voluntarily waived a big chunk of it as well.

The temporary mosque was completed and officially opened on 13th December 1999. The Guest of honour for the day did not turn up and the occasion was presided over by our two erstwhile Patrons, and attended by a number of guests who had assisted us thus far.`

            subtitle: "PURCHASE OF PLOT NO. 2: LR 2258",
            content: `As we were in the midst of building the temporary mosque, the owner of the adjacent plot offered it to us to buy. Again although a non-Muslim, the owner gave us the first right of refusal. We negotiated with him and agreed on the price of Kshs. one million. As before, at the time of signing the Sale Agreement, we had next to nothing in our account. We were however, just like for the first plot, confident that we would be able to raise the required amount.

Just before the said official opening of the temporary mosque, we shared the information with our Patrons. They proposed that we conduct an impromptu Harambee during the occasion. This was done and the event raised around Kshs. 500,000/-, that is half of the money required for the 2nd plot.

Thereafter the Women wing of LIWO, under the very able leadership of the then Chairlady, Madam Zahra Saad (wife of our member Marhum Barzhan Kombo Sikudhane), took it upon themselves to raise the rest. This they did through food bazaars and hosting of their own Harambee.

We once again managed to clear payments ahead of schedule and took possession of the plot.`

            subtitle: "STATUTORY PAYMENTS AND STATUS",
            content: `Upon acquisition of the two plots, steps were taken to get exemptions from payment of Stamp Duties and Land Rates. The exemptions were awarded.

Applications to convert the two plots from commercial to religious use were also accepted and granted.`
        },
        {
            subtitle: "RAMADHAN IFTAR PROGRAMMES",
            content: `From inception, LIWO initiated two programs of Iftar during every month of Ramadhan. One was to provide cooked Iftar every day at the mosque. This is to cater for those with nowhere to go for Iftar. The second was to provide raw foodstuff to the less endowed Muslim families.

Over the years, these programs have benefitted many deserving families. The list of beneficiaries is reviewed regularly, including through physical visits to ensure no one who is eligible is left out.

At this point it is opportune to mention some of the donors who have over the years been providing us with the foodstuff we use for cooking and distribution. These include Pembe Flour Mills, Mombasa Maize Millers, Unique Supplies (Brother F. S Abdullah), Khandwalla, Gulf African Bank, First Community Bank (currently Premier Bank).`
        },
        {
            subtitle: "ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS",
            content: `From the time the existing mosque came into being, there have been some incremental developments that have taken place. These include construction of Imam's house, Caretaker's room, additional toilets, Women's praying place, additional Madrasa classes, drilling of a borehole, etc. Except for the borehole which was sponsored by an individual, all the other additions were locally financed through members' contributions.

The drilling of the borehole commenced on 10th November 2023 and was finalized in February 2024, when water became available.`

        {
            subtitle: "PROMOTION OF EDUCATION",
            content: `In 1991, in conjunction with the Pakistan High Commission in Nairobi and the Kenyan High Commission in Pakistan, LIWO brokered an arrangement where Kenyan students could join various Universities in Pakistan in a self-sponsored basis at very affordable costs.

LIWO advertised the openings in many mosques and undertook to process all the applications, which were in the hundreds, received from many parts of the country for various faculties. The summaries were submitted to the selected Universities through the Pakistan High Commission.

This initiative benefited a number of Muslim students who successfully went and completed their University education in Pakistan. There were some who got full scholarships while some others benefited from bursaries issued by the Government of Pakistan.

Unfortunately this was a one off exercise because the Pakistan High Commissioner we were personally dealing with, was thereafter transferred and his replacement was not as cooperative.`

        {
            subtitle: "RUNNING OF THE MOSQUE",
            content: `Day-to-day running of the mosque is generally financed by contributions and donations from the congregants and well-wishers. In this respect it is appropriate to appreciate the contribution of our pioneer Patron Abdulrahman Abbas in the monthly payments for the Imam. Even after his demise, his family has gracefully continued with the payments to date. The same appreciation goes to Bro. Ali Ahmed of Mombasa Maize Millers, who has been catering for the monthly payments of the mosque caretaker. In addition he pays for the electricity used at the mosque.`
        },
        {
            subtitle: "LONG-TERM ASPIRATIONS",
            content: `From the time the first plot was purchased, the general ambition of the members has always been to transform the place into a Centre of Excellence for Islam. Apart from a decent mosque to accommodate both men and women, it was envisaged to have modern day Madrasa classes, a well-stocked library, a meeting hall, Imam's residence, etc.

To this end, building plans and drawings encompassing the above aspirations were drawn and submitted to Nairobi City Council in 16/12/15 at a fee of Kshs 963,548.00. These were approved. Because we could not build within the required period, the approval lapsed. We renewed the approval on 09/5/19 at a fee of Kshs 121,360/= Again this period lapsed without us being able to commence construction. We hence had to renew the approval the third time on 09/06/22 at a fee of Kshs.72,462.00 It is this approval we seek to use for the current amended drawings and plans.

Upon the approval of the initial drawings and plans, a number of Muslim Organization's, Foreign Missions and other individuals have been approached with a view to help us achieve the desired results. Although generally well-received, we have not succeeded in getting a sponsor meeting our long-term vision. We have had a number of near misses where consensus was reached but matters fizzling out inexplicably.

Hence our zeal for this local initiative.`

Also worth special mention are our joint Patrons, Marhum Alhajj Abdulrahman Abbas and Marhum Ahmed Abdallah who tirelessly stood with us in our long journey. We also appreciate the role played by lawyer Farouk Adam who handled all the conveyancing of the parcels of land we bought, pro bono. Lastly Ustadh Hassan Komesha needs to go on record as the very first Ustadh of the Madrasa.

The very first Chairman of LIWO was Said Gatibaru with Marhum Said Omar Nadhir as his Vice. The pioneer Secretary was Mohamed Salim Bwika, and Treasurer was Mohamed Salim Mbui.

When the Chairman relocated from Langata, he voluntarily relinquished his position allowing Marhum Said Omar Nadhir to become the Chairman, with Sudi Abdalla as his Vice. Later the Secretary and Treasurer also relocated from Nairobi and surrendered their positions. This ushered in Yaqub Ibrahim Nyang'ai as the Secretary and Juma Abdalla Kathenge the Treasurer, both of whom continue holding the positions.

Upon the death of Said Omar Nadhir on 29th June 2023, Professor Mohamed Suleiman Mukras became the Chairman with Sudi Abdalla continuing to deputise. Unfortunately, after a short stint in office, the Professor also died on 5th August 2024. As a result Said Ibrahim became the Chairman with Sudi Abdalla still deputising.`
